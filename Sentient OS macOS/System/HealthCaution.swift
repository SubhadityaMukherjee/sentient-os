//  HealthCaution.swift
//  Sentient OS macOS
//
//  The home's LIVE health banner — the sibling of OvernightCaution (which records a past event,
//  this probes CURRENT state). One ladder, most severe first: ① an essential permission is off
//  (Full Disk Access · the overnight wake helper · launch at login — all gated green in
//  onboarding, so any red here is drift) → ② codex is gone or signed out → ③ computer use broke
//  AFTER it was once seen working (the everReady latch, so a user who never set it up is never
//  nagged). The home renders the top un-muted rung as a red capsule (HomeView.cautionBanner) and
//  re-probes on foreground, so a fix in Settings clears the banner the moment the user returns.
//  Nothing is persisted: no state, no record — broken shows, fixed melts away. ✕ mutes an issue
//  KIND for the app session; lower rungs still surface. Knowledge-base-only (free plan) homes get
//  no banners at all — nothing nightly runs for them. The codex login check shells out (seconds),
//  so its verdict is cached ~5 min; the cache is bypassed while a codex banner is up.
//
//  Key methods: probe(forceCodexRecheck:) · dismiss(_:) · latchComputerUse()

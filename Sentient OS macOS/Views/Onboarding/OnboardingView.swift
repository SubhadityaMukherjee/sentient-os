//  OnboardingView.swift
//  Sentient OS macOS
//
//  First-launch onboarding: the film slide (OnboardingFilmView — the website's self-scrolling
//  film in a webview, parking on the morning home),
//  then permissions (OnboardingPermissionsView), then codex login (OnboardingCodexSteps),
//  then the plan crossroads (OnboardingPlanView — free/go accounts only; full plans skip it),
//  then the ready-to-process screen (OnboardingReadyView) whose Start Analysis presents the REAL
//  ProcessingView takeover (pausable) — and only a finished run calls `onFinished` and reveals
//  the home. If the on-device model hasn't finished downloading (ModelDownload — AppState kicks
//  it 2s after the post-FDA-relaunch launch), Start Analysis shows the downloading-model screen
//  first and the analysis takes over by itself the moment the model verifies. The current step
//  persists (UserDefaults "onboarding.step") so a quit-and-relaunch mid-onboarding — which
//  granting Full Disk Access requires — resumes exactly where the user left. The background
//  codex install is NOT here: AppState kicks it off 1s after launch while the film plays.
//  Computer use (codex step 3) IS here: the analysis takeover appearing arms a silent
//  one-shot that bootstraps it 2 minutes in (armComputerUseSetup) — armed at analysis start,
//  not at Start Analysis, so its ~535 MB DMG never competes with the model download's tail.

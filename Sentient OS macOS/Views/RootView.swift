//  RootView.swift
//  Sentient OS macOS
//
//  The main window's switchboard: the proactive HomeView (idle) ⟷ the full-screen
//  ProcessingView takeover (today they cross-fade). RootView owns the analyze/source state and
//  feeds HomeView its live context; Analyze Now (in the home's Analysis popover) runs whatever
//  the dev source picker has armed (SourceSelection). The picker + all debug controls live in
//  DevToolsView, a sheet reached from the home's DEV TOOLS handle (DEBUG builds only).

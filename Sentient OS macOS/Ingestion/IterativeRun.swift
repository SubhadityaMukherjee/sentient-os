//  IterativeRun.swift
//  Sentient OS macOS
//
//  The connector-agnostic on-device orchestrator — the ONE engine path behind BOTH the home
//  "Analyze Now" takeover and the dev "start on device" buttons (both via ProcessingView). Drives
//  any Connector through ONE Engine (sized to the biggest connector), per BUCKET. Every processed
//  item commits its (optional) survivor note AND its progress marker in ONE atomic store write — so a
//  crash mid-run resumes, never duplicates, never skips:
//   • .initial   (top→bottom): fill the bucket newest→oldest, sinking a FLOOR per item (the oldest
//                  done so far). A crash RESUMES strictly below the floor instead of restarting; on
//                  reaching the bottom the floor collapses into the normal high-water mark.
//   • .iterative (bottom→top): take items past the mark, walk oldest→newest, advancing the mark per
//                  item. No mark yet (or a first run unfinished) ⇒ skipped — run initial first.
//   • .auto:      per bucket — initial if it has no mark yet OR a first run is mid-descent (floor
//                  set, i.e. resume it), else iterative. This is the home button's mode: the first
//                  run backfills, every run after catches up, a freshly-added folder backfills while
//                  the rest catch up, and an interrupted first run picks up where it left off.
//  Reuses Engine + Triage + the GPU-wedge resilience (preemptive + reactive reloads). Survivors →
//  CycleNote; junk/sensitive store nothing (zero trace). Synchronous generate() only — no streaming.
